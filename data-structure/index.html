    <h1>Data structure</h1>
    <p>
      The goal is to understand when we use an array or an object and how
      to use them.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">Array</a></h2>
    <p>
      Arrays are used to store a list of elements. The array prototype has methods
      which allows mutation operations (add, remove and access element ...).
      Arrays use <strong>integer</strong> indexes. Arrays are ordered lists.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open your console and follow the instruction in the array.js script.
    </p>

    <h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object">Object</a></h2>
    <p>
      Objects are used to store data with named properties. Object are used when
      you need to access data with identifiers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open your console and follow the instruction in the object.js script.
